## Code to (indefinitely) cycle through (and print) the items of a list

```js
function main(startAt = 0) {
  let counter = startAt;
  const list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];

  setInterval(() => {
    const index = counter % list.length;
    console.log(list[index]);
    counter++;
  }, 1000);
}

main();
```
